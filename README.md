# Data_Analysis_With_Python

(Coursera IBM Data Science Professional Certificate).

Importing Datasets 1.0 = Learning how to understand data and how to use the libraries in Python to help  import data from multiple sources. Learning how to perform some basic tasks to start exploring and analyzing the imported data set.
- Analyze Python data using a dataset.
- Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses.
- Read data using Python's Pandas package.
- Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python.

Data Wrangling 2.0 = Learning how to perform some fundamental data wrangling tasks that, together, form the pre-processing phase of data analysis. These tasks include handling missing values in data, formatting data to standardize it and make it consistent, normalizing data, grouping data values into bins, and converting categorical variables into numerical quantitative variables.
- Describe how to handle missing values.
- Describe data formatting techniques.
- Describe data normalization.
- Demonstrate the use of binning.
