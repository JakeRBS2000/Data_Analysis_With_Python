# Data_Analysis_With_Python

(Coursera IBM Data Science Professional Certificate).

Importing Datasets (DA0101EN.Review) = Learning how to understand data and how to use the libraries in Python to help  import data from multiple sources. Learning how to perform some basic tasks to start exploring and analyzing the imported data set.
- Analyze Python data using a dataset.
- Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses.
- Read data using Python's Pandas package.
- Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python.

Data Wrangling (DA0101EN-2) = Learning how to perform some fundamental data wrangling tasks that, together, form the pre-processing phase of data analysis. These tasks include handling missing values in data, formatting data to standardize it and make it consistent, normalizing data, grouping data values into bins, and converting categorical variables into numerical quantitative variables.
- Describe how to handle missing values.
- Describe data formatting techniques.
- Describe data normalization.
- Demonstrate the use of binning.
- Demonstrate the use of categotical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (DA0101EN-3) = Learning what is meant by exploratory data analysis, and  how to perform computations on the data to calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data. Learning to put data into groups to help  visualize the data better, and how to use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables, and  the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them.
- Implement descriptive statistics.
- Demonstrate the basics of grouping.
- Describe data correlation processes.
- Describe why and how to apply the Chi-Squared test.

Model Development (DA0101EN-4) = Learning how to define the explanatory variable and the response variable and understand the differences between the simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models. How to evaluate a model using visualization and learn about polynomial regression and pipelines. Learning how to interpret and use the R-squared and the mean square error measures to perform in-sample evaluations to numerically evaluate our model. And lastly, about prediction and decision making when determining if our model is correct.
- Describe how to process linear regression in Python.
- Apply model evaluation using visualization in Python.
- Apply polynomial regression techniques to Python.
- Evaluate a data model by using visualization.
- Describe the use of R-squared and MSE for in-sample evaluation.
- Apply prediction and decision making to Python model creation.

Model Evaluation (DA0101EN-5) = Learning about the importance of model evaluation and different data model refinement techniques. Learning about model selection and how to identify overfitting and underfitting in a predictive model. Learning about using Ridge Regression to regularize and reduce standard errors to prevent overfitting a regression model and how to use the Grid Search method to tune the hyperparameters of an estimator.
- Describe data model refinement techniques.
- Explain overfitting, underfitting and model selection.
- Apply ridge regression to regularize and reduce the standard errors to avoid overfitting a regression model.
- Apply grid search techniques to Python data.

Final Assignment (House Sales In King County, USA) = Assuming the role of a Data Analyst working at a real estate investment trust organization who wants to start investing in residential real estate. Given a dataset containing detailed information about house prices in the region based on a number of property features, and it the task is to analyze and predict the market price of houses given that information.
- Create a Jupyter notebook.
- Apply data analysis and modeling techniques to housing price datA.
